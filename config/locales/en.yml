 description: "Hate-motivated incidents are often violent manifestations of intolerance which instil fear and divide communities. Tackling underlying prejudice is essential in combating the spread of these divisive actions. The OSCE Mission to BiH supports the work of government institutions, the criminal justice system, local authorities and civil society to effectively respond to these incidents. The Hate Monitor provides a monthly update on incidents and responses throughout BiH."
